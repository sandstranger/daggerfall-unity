[/center]Rude Song

[/font=4]

[/center]In the spring of the year

[/center]Doth propriety disappear

[/center]In the courts and the ports

[/center]Of the Bay.

[/center]Drinking new beer,

[/center]Everybody feels queer

[/center]And the Earls and the churls

[/center]Go astray.

[/center]The bee and the bird

[/center]Don't have to tell us a word.

[/center]Our bodies for naughtie

[/center]Are prime.

[/center]If you haven't heard,

[/center]You can let yourself be lured

[/center]For the youth, for things uncouth,

[/center]It is time.

[/center]Oh, it's lovely to sit in a field, harvested into rows

[/center]It's lovelier still to do the same not wearing any clothes.

[/center]

[/center]People of the Bay bless

[/center]The flowered court of Wayrest

[/center]For showing us the gentle way of sin

[/center]The bonny Dark Elf queen

[/center]Likes to see and to be seen

[/center]With cobblers, thieves,

[/center]And tavernkeeps,

[/center]And slaves, and fish-er-men

[/center]In the court of Lainlyn,

[/center]Right upon the mainland

[/center]With sex, the whole place is in a whirl

[/center]The Baroness likes to play

[/center]With men who come her way,

[/center]While the Baron likes the little boys and girls.

[/center]Oh, it's lovely to give your lady a kiss upon her nose

[/center]It's lovelier still to do the same not wearing any clothes.

[/center]

[/center]In Daggerfall,

[/center]they hold a ball

[/center]And all of society indulges in a variety

[/center]Of scandal, they can handle -- A lot.

[/center]The Captain of the Guard

[/center]Has to search very hard

[/center]For a bean that the Queen

[/center]Has in her pants.

[/center]And the Court Sorceress

[/center]Will grant you a wish

[/center]To cause the King to fling

[/center]About his lance.

[/center]Oh, it's lovely to give your love a single perfect rose

[/center]It's lovelier still to do the same not wearing any clothes.

[/center]Oh, it's lovely to abandon all your cares and fears and woes

[/center]It's lovelier still to do the same not wearing any clothes.

[/center]Yes sir, it's lovely not wear any clothes!"
